# Output your vault passphrase within this script
#
# You should have one script per inventory. E.g.:
# - For integration/hosts inventory,
#     pass-integration.sh
# - For production/hosts inventory,
#     pass-production.sh

#
# Recommended approach is to use a password manager:
# - Vault from Hashicorp for example (https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault.html)
# - GPG encrypted password manager (https://www.passwordstore.org/)
